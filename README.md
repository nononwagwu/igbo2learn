# Igbo2Learn

**Igbo2Learn** is a cultural awareness web platform dedicated to celebrating and preserving Igbo language, traditions, proverbs, and heritage. It aims to connect users with their Igbo roots through interactive lessons, proverbs, quizzes, and cultural content.

## Project Goal

- **Basic Igbo Lessons:** Beginner-friendly language tutorials with common phrases and pronunciation guides.
- **Proverbs & Stories:** Explore deep wisdom and values passed down through generations.
- **Cultural Corner:** Discover Igbo traditional dances, festivals, attire, music, and cuisine.
- **Interactive Quizzes:** Test your Igbo knowledge and track your progress (planned for future backend integration).
- **Get Your Igbo Name:** A fun feature to generate Igbo names based on user input.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- **Backend:** Node.js (planned for quiz progress tracking and user data management)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for source control and collaboration
